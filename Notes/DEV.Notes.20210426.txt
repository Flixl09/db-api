if you get rid of 'from flaskext.mysql import MySQL' and use libmysql c client (import mysql.connector)
then you can also get rid of 'import cryptography' and is faster performance

```
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  password="yourpassword"
)

print(mydb) 
```
