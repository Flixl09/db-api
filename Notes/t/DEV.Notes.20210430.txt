GET    /api/<db>/<table>/count       # Count number of rows in a table

...  i've seen databases get clobbered by count(*)
     expecially when we moved from myisam to innodb


SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ... WHERE ...

try:

SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS 1 FROM table;
SELECT FOUND_ROWS();

select sql_calc_found_rows * from table_name limit 0 ; 
select found_rows() as table_rows ;

and how accurate is this...?
select  table_rows
from    information_schema.tables
where   table_schema = 'database_name'
  and   table_name = 'table_name' ;
