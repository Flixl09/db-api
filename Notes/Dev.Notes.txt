can be use to ping a table if it has changed


```
SELECT table_schema,table_name,update_time
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE update_time > (NOW() - INTERVAL 5 MINUTE);
```

curl --user dbuser:dbpass "http://127.0.0.1:8980/api/information_schema/tables/table1?column=TABLE_NAME&fields=TABLE_SCHEMA,TABLE_NAME,UPDATE_TIME"

select TABLE_SCHEMA,TABLE_NAME,UPDATE_TIME from information_schema.tables where TABLE_NAME='table1';

# note that it'd be better to have table name AND database name example, as it is possible to have more than one table with this name.  
#      yet it works...  just account for possible multiples.
#
# and make me think perhaps adding to the api ?where= and or
