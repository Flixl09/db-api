8980

app default port is tcp 8980

history of 8980...  why/where did i get this number?.  basically, after testing maxscale i had thier 8989 port in my brain.  MaxScale REST API listens on port 8989.  so, since http is default plain text on tcp 80, i figured i'd keep in mind its all plain text here at 8980.

```
curl -X PATCH  \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/json"  \
     -d "{\"Id\": 78912,\"Customer\": \"Krink\",\"Quantity\": 1,\"Price\": 99.00}" \
    https://127.0.0.1:8980/api/example/table1/3
```

ugh.  i hate PATCH return 204 No Content 

when i set return to 
return jsonify(status=204, message="No Content"), 204
 the body response is not actually returned to the client, only the headers...
i like the response body to have a message/success/ or something more than just headers...
look; i understand we're following a standard here... 
- The response 204 means that the request was processed successfully
- when a 204 response code is used, the response does not carry a payload body.
