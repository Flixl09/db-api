Success! Created db-api-react at /Users/krink/db-api/clients/ReactJS/db-api-react
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

  cd db-api-react
  npm start

```
